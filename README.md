# AHC - Automated Home Controller
Automating energy consumption to maximize self-consumption and minimize peak usage.
## Overview
The scope of this project is controlling outlets remotely via WiFi for energy-intensive devices such as a dishwasher, electric heater, washing machine, etc.

Every outlet will feature a "smart-plug" that is controlled by a central main control unit. This unit will also act as a user interface to display data like current production and usage.
